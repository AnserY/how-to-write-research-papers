# How to Write Research Papers

I'm a Ph. D student working on robotics and deep learning. Like most researchers, I also need to publish research papers. Preparing research papers takes much effort and time. Sometimes it even gives pains. However, I realized that there are a bunch of materials on the web I can benefit from and started summarizing those materials. This document might contain disputable statements since it is for my personal retrieval. I welcome comments and collaboration. Please send me e-mails or pull requests.

## Key Things to Keep in Mind

### Write Now!
<img src="writing_paradigm.png" width="500">

- "Writing first" forces you to be clear & focused
- It helps you develop the idea
- It makes what you don't understand concrete

### Top Down
- Identify your key idea and contributions
  - Just one clear and sharp idea
  - If you have lots of ideas, write lots of papers
- Tell a story
  - Not what you did, but rather new idea or insights
  - Basic flow
    - Here is a problem
    - It's interesting and unsolved
    - Here is my idea
    - My idea works (details or data)
    - How my idea differs from others
- A lead sentence to set context for a paragraph

### Reader Centered
- Get to the message ASAP
  - Convey the intuition primarily; details are secondary
  - State your contributions clearly
- Visualize (figures) & summarize (tables)
- Don't let readers work hard
  - Be consise, accurate and clear; present enough context & information
  - Not too many equations or graphs or paragraphs
- Check what readers might (want/not want) and (know/not know)

### Take Time
- Reflect, write, review, and refine
- Take time to write less

### Where to Focus
- Title (1000 readers)
- Abstract (4 sentences, 100 readers)
- Introduction (1 Page, 100 readers)
- The problem (1 page, 10 readers)
- My idea (2 pages, 10 readers)
- The details (5 pages, 3 readers)
- Related work (1-2 pages, 10 readers)
- Conclusion and future works (0.5 pages)
