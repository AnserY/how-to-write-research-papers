# How to Write Research Papers

I'm a Ph. D student working on robotics and deep learning. Like most researchers, I also need to publish research papers. Preparing research papers takes much effort and time. Sometimes it even gives pains. However, I realized that there are a bunch of materials on the web I can benefit from and started summarizing those materials. This document might contain disputable statements since it is for my personal retrieval. I welcome comments and collaboration. Please send me e-mails or pull requests.

### Reader Centered
- Get to the message ASAP
- Visualize (figures) & summarize (tables)
- Present enough context & information
- Don't let readers work hard
  - be consise and clear
  - not too many equations or graphs or paragraphs
- Check what readers might (want/not want) and (know/not know)

### Take Time
- Reflect, write, review, and refine
- Take time to write less
